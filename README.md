We list all the generated videos here in each folder.

The prompt benchmark we collected is shown in `mtv_bench_prompt.txt`.


## ðŸ›  How to Use the Prompt-to-Video Mapping Code

### âœ… Step 1: Confirm Prompt Text Format

Ensure your prompt file (e.g., `mtv_bench_prompt.txt`) follows this structure:

- Each group contains **2â€“4 prompts**, each on its own line  
- Each group is separated by a line with `###`  
- No blank lines between prompts or groups

Example:

    A dog chases a ball in the park, wide shot with green grass surrounding.
    A dog sits patiently in the park, wide shot with green grass surrounding.
    ###
    A cat climbs a tree in the yard, medium shot with sunlight filtering through the leaves.
    A cat lays on the windowsill, medium shot with sunlight filtering through the leaves.
    ###
    A horse gallops across the field, wide shot with a mountain in the background.
    A horse rests under a tree, wide shot with a mountain in the background.

> This format ensures correct parsing when generating the prompt-to-video JSON mapping.

### âœ… Step 2: Correctly Set Path Variables

Before running the evaluation code (e.g., `semanticalignment_overallalignment.py` )make sure the following paths are correctly set:

```python
PROMPT_PATH = "/path/to/prompts.txt"                      # Path to your prompt text file
VIDEO_DIR = "/path/to/videos"                             # Directory containing the generated videos
OUTPUT_JSON = "/path/to/output/change-alignment_check.json"  # Output file for saving the mapping or score
