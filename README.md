## ðŸ›  How to Use the Prompt-to-Video Mapping Code

### âœ… Step 1: Confirm Prompt Text Format

Ensure your prompt file (e.g., `mtv_bench_prompt.txt`) follows the correct structure:

- Each group of **2â€“4 prompts** is separated by `###`
- Each prompt is a **single line**
- **No empty lines** between prompts

Example:

A dog chases a ball in the park, wide shot with green grass surrounding.
A dog sits patiently in the park, wide shot with green grass surrounding.
###
A cat climbs a tree in the yard, medium shot with sunlight filtering through the leaves.
A cat lays on the windowsill, medium shot with sunlight filtering through the leaves.


> This format is required for downstream mapping and evaluation tools to parse the prompts correctly.
